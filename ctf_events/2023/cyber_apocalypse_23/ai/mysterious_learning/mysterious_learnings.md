# Mysterious Learnings

## Description

> One day the archeologist came across a strange metal plate covered in uncommon hieroglyphics. It looked like blueprints for some kind of alien technology. "What kind of magic is this?" He studied the plate more closely and was amazed by the advanced technology and incredible engineering they were using at a time like this. This could only lead him in him wanting to learn more...

## Solution

Challenge looks similar to previous years [Cyber Apocalypse](https://ctftime.org/writeup/27743), even with the same filename `alien.h5` but doesn't come with any training data.

First tried to open the model with [Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/download) but didn't find much, can also use python.

```python
import h5py
from tensorflow.keras.models import model_from_json

filename = 'alien.h5'
with h5py.File(filename, 'r') as f:
    model_weights_attrs = dict(f['model_weights'].attrs)
    model_architecture = f.attrs['model_config']

model = model_from_json(model_architecture)
model.load_weights(filename)

print("Layers in the model:")
print("=====================")
model.summary()
```

```bash
